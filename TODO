Organize project
-Create test directory, put tests there
-put extension for {-# LANGUAGE GeneralizedNewtypeDeriving #-} in Cabal file
-add comments, especially from Spec
-put everything in its own namespace
-rename project
-clean up Main
-run hlint, follow suggestions
-refactor concatenate methods in Utilities to use unlines.map?
-add compiler warnings to Cabal file, clean them up
-refactor Int types to use Num a instead of Int so I don't have to use fromIntegral everywhere? alternatively, some sort of typeclass for the various addresses?
-add a function for getting all ZStringAddresses corresponding to a single string? that way, I can refactor readZString and zStringLength as folds
